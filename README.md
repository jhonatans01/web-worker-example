# Example of Web Worker using Service Worker

This is a ReactJS app with very basic configuration to run locally and on a server. We used Heroku server to host this project, but it can probably be hosted somewhere else. \
We cache files and send messages between the threads of the application.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits, but keep in mind that the files are cached by the service worker.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode using webpack.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm start`

After the project is built, this command will run the files into the `dist` folder.
